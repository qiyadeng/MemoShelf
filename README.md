## Why SnipForge

You have hundreds of commands across Docker, Kubernetes, Git, SSH, APIs, and internal tooling. Some live in Notion, some in Slack messages, some you just google every time. SnipForge puts them all in one place — a global hotkey palette that opens from anywhere, searches instantly, and copies to your clipboard with variable substitution.

Teams use it to share command libraries via GitHub repos. New members subscribe to the team library and have every command at their fingertips.

## Features

**Global hotkey** — One shortcut opens SnipForge from any app. Type to search, arrow keys to navigate, Enter to copy. Configurable in settings.

**Variables** — Use `{{variable name}}` templates. When you copy, SnipForge prompts you to fill in each value before it hits your clipboard.

```bash
/add customer {{Customer Name}}
```

</p>

**Multi-format editors** — Plain text, rich text (TipTap), Markdown, and syntax-highlighted code for 15+ languages (JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Bash, SQL, YAML, and more).

**Team libraries** — Share command collections through GitHub repos or local folders. Curators publish, members subscribe. Auto-sync keeps everyone current.

**Privacy-first** — Everything stays on your machine. SQLite database, no cloud, no accounts required, no telemetry. GitHub auth is optional and only used for team library sync.

**Keyboard-driven** — Full navigation without a mouse. Customizable shortcuts for every action.

## The Armory

SnipForge ships with **The Armory** — a curated starter library of 477 commands across 39 categories including Git, Docker, Kubernetes, SSH, curl, PostgreSQL, nginx, n8n, and more. Import it from `The Armory/` in this repo, or use it as a reference for building your own libraries.
